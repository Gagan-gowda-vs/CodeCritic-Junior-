## 🎯 About The Project

Learning to code is more than just making a program work; it's about writing code that is **clean, efficient, and readable**. However, many beginners struggle with these best practices, often forming bad habits early on.

**CodeCritic Junior** bridges this gap by providing an AI-enhanced educational dashboard that acts as a friendly coding mentor. Our platform analyzes user code in real-time to detect stylistic issues, suggest improvements, and offer interactive learning modules to foster strong programming foundations.
